# Concrete-Strength-Test
## Project done during internship on Datamites
## Problem Statement: To predict the full strength of concrete from the given data
Concrete as a building block of most construction is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from the laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled). The data has 8 quantitative input variables, 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances (observations).
The project is done by using three methods based on Regression, the first is Linear Regression, the second is Lasso Regression, and the third one is Ridge Regression.
Different analyses are done from data cleaning, preprocessing, balancing, feature selection, bivariate and univariate analysis, to graphical analysis, training and testing, evaluating performance and selection best model.
